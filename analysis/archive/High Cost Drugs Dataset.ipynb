    "# High cost drugs dataset\n",
    "## Short data report\n",
    "\n",
    "This short report describes how high cost drugs data can be identified in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, and the strengths and weaknesses of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a living document that will be updated to reflect changes to the OpenSAFELY-TPP database and the patient records within.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The high cost drugs dataset is a patient level dataset that provides information on the use of drugs that are tariff-excluded. These are medicines that are not reimbursed directly through the national tariff and comissioned directly by NHS England & Improvement (NHSEI) specialised commissioning or Clinic Commissioning Groups (CCGs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of the collection of data on the use of high cost drugs is for payments from NHSEI specialised commissioning or CCGs to hospitals once a drug has been supplied to a patient. Hospitals fill out a submission for each patient and each high cost drug and submit this to either a CCG or NHSEI specialised commissioning, based on which organisation is the commissioner, to recieve payment. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a secondary use these individual submissions can then be collected together to provide information on the total number of patients treated with high cost drugs, the volume of high cost drugs used and the cost of these medicines to commissioners. The dataset also provides information on clinical indications, the reason a patient was treated with the high cost drug, and the month the patient was treated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creation of the national high cost drugs dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The high cost drug payment request submissions are routinely collected together to produce datasets at an individual CCG and NHSEI specialised commissioning level. However, despite clear use cases for national policy and clinical teams, academics and other stakeholders, this data had never been collected together to provide a national overview of the use of high cost drugs in England prior to the work of the North of England Commissioing Support Unit (NECS) and the DataLab in spring/summer 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "*To add information on how national data collection was proposed/approved*\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the first national high cost drugs dataset the NECS collected submissions from all commissioners in England - this covers *135?* CCGs and NHSEI specialised commissioning. The scope of the original dataset was all high cost drugs sumbissions from FY 2018/19 and FY 2019/20.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NECS faced a number of challenges in collecting and collating the submissions from this range of providers, particularly around data uniformity and validation. These are discussed further in the \"Challenges\" section of this data report."

    "## Variable overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The national high cost drugs dataset is a patient level dataset and includes variables on patient characteristics, clinical indications and medicine prescribed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data collection of inidivudal submissions is called the Drugs Patient Level Contract Monitoring Data Set and the national specification for submissions is published on the [NHS Data Model and Dictionary website](https://datadictionary.nhs.uk/data_sets/supporting_data_sets/drugs_patient_level_contract_monitoring_data_set.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The NECS collated together the submissions from each CCG and NHSEI specialised commissioning to create a national dataset. The version of this dataset shared with OpenSafely and TPP includes a subset of the variables from the national specification and some derived variables. The dataset shared with OpenSafely and TPP only includes patients that are or were registered at a GP practice that uses the TPP EHRC systems. This data collection is therefore a sample of the full national high cost drugs dataset that the NECS produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Don't know whether to include this bit as only saved on OpenSafley google drive at mo - would need to be published*\n",
    "NECS provided a meta data file for the high cost drugs dataset, this is [saved here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i_Ux8UveZR8brMDO0-_TV_tYfWMLSSHY/edit?rtpof=true#gid=1394523185)\n",
