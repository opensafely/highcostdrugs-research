    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The high cost drugs dataset is a patient level dataset that provides information on the use of drugs that are tariff-excluded. These are medicines that are not reimbursed directly through the national tariff and comissioned either by NHS England & Improvement (NHSEI) specialised commissioning or Clinic Commissioning Groups (CCGs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of the collection of data on the use of high cost drugs is for payments from NHSEI specialised commissioning or CCGs to hospitals once a drug has been prescribed to a patient. Hospitals fill out a submission for each patient and each high cost drug and submit this to either a CCG or NHSEI specialised commissioning, based on which organisation is the commissioner, to recieve payment. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a secondary use these individual submissions can then be collected together to provide information on the total number of patients treated with high cost drugs, the volume of high cost drugs used and the cost of these medicines to commissioners. The dataset also provides information on clinical indications, the reason a patient was treated with the high cost drug, and the month the patient was treated."

    "## Analysing high cost drugs data in OpenSAFELY\n",
    "\n",
    "High cost drugs data is available for analysis via the OpenSAFELY platform to answer COVID-19 related research questions. The high cost drugs data can be analysed via OpenSAFELY study definitions and linked to information from patient GP records, COVID-19 related datasets (tests and results), hospital admissions and episodes data and data on patient outcomes. This will allow new insight in to the possible interactions between the medication a patient takes and COVID outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, three variables from the high cost drugs dataset can be queried in an OpenSAFELY study:\n",
    "* FinancialMonth\n",
    "* FinancialYear\n",
    "* DrugName\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables are the ones most relevant to current research questions and add new information not available in other OpenSAFELY datasets. These are also some of the most complete variables in the dataset. Other variables included in the high cost drugs dataset are described in Table one and two below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to analyse data via OpenSAFELY study definitions are set out in this [guidance](https://docs.opensafely.org/en/latest/). There are some specific things to note when including the high cost drugs dataset in any analysis:\n",
    "* You will need to create bespoke codelists to cover the medications of interest - as the drug name variable does not follow an existing naming convention these codelists are created by reviewing the list of all unique values in the drug name variable and selecting the ones that are relevant to your research question. \n",
    "    * A list of the existing high cost drugs codelists on OpenSAFELY codelists can be found [here](https://codelists.opensafely.org/?q=High+cost+drugs). Check this to see if a codelist already exists for your medications of interest.\n",
    "    * If a codelist does not already exist then you will need to create one. These codelists will need to be based on the unique values of the drug name variable. A list of all the unique values for the drug name variable can be found here (add link!).\n",
    "    * Once you have created the codelist/lists for the medicines of interest these need to be reviewed and uploaded to [OpenSAFELY codelists](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/add/), following the process set out in [this guidance](https://docs.opensafely.org/en/latest/codelist-creation/).(High cost drugs approach is slightly different - does the guidance need to be updated to reflect this?)\n",
    "    \n",
    "* When you are ready to run your study definition and analysis via the [Job Runner](https://jobs.opensafely.org/) you will need to run on the full set of data as the high cost drugs dataset is not yet included in the slice of data (which can be used to test your study runs as expected)."

    "## Background information - Creation of the national high cost drugs dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The high cost drug payment request submissions are routinely collected together to produce datasets at an individual CCG and NHSEI specialised commissioning level. However, despite clear use cases for national policy and clinical teams, academics and other stakeholders, this data had never been collected together to provide a national overview of the use of high cost drugs in England prior to the work of the North of England Commissioing Support Unit (NECS) and the DataLab in spring/summer 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "*To add information on how national data collection was proposed/approved*\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the first national high cost drugs dataset the NECS collected submissions from all commissioners in England - this covers 135 CCGs and NHSEI specialised commissioning. The scope of the original dataset was all high cost drugs sumbissions from FY 2018/19 and FY 2019/20.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NECS faced a number of challenges in collecting and collating the submissions from this range of providers, particularly around data uniformity and validation. The impact of these challenges are discussed for each variable where relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveats**\n",
    "* The NECS are unable to say with any certainty that the data received is a complete data set for each Provider and Commissioner for FY 2018/19 and FY 2019/20.\n",
    "* The drug names and some other text inputs are non-standardised, this is a feature of the data collection process. This means that further data cleaning and standardisation is required each time the high cost drugs dataset is used for new analysis.\n",
    "* The NECS are unable to comment on the level of data validation that had been undertaken by commissioners before the data was submitted to them for collation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further information on the NECS data collation and cleaning processes can be found in [this document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JbUPp962KRNGsIC1wThexdMUrV0XOb-D/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs) (This is currently on the DataLab google drive so needs to be moved to a public place if going to be referenced here.)"

    "## Variable overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The national high cost drugs dataset is a patient level dataset and includes variables on patient characteristics, clinical indications and medicine prescribed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data collection of inidivudal submissions is called the Drugs Patient Level Contract Monitoring Data Set and the national specification for submissions is published on the [NHS Data Model and Dictionary website](https://datadictionary.nhs.uk/data_sets/supporting_data_sets/drugs_patient_level_contract_monitoring_data_set.html). A full list of the variables collected via submissions and specification for each variable can be found via this link.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NECS collated together the submissions to all commissioners in England to create a national dataset. The version of this dataset shared with OpenSAFELY includes a subset of the variables from the national specification and some derived variables. The dataset shared with OpenSAFELY only includes patients that are or were registered at a GP practice that uses the TPP EHRC systems. This data collection is therefore a sample of the full national high cost drugs dataset that the NECS produced.\n",
