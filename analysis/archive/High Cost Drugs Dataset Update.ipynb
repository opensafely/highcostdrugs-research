    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The high cost drugs dataset is a patient level dataset that provides information on the use of drugs that are tariff-excluded. These are medicines that are not reimbursed directly through the national tariff and comissioned directly by NHS England & Improvement (NHSEI) specialised commissioning or Clinic Commissioning Groups (CCGs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of the collection of data on the use of high cost drugs is for payments from NHSEI specialised commissioning or CCGs to hospitals once a drug has been supplied to a patient. Hospitals fill out a submission for each patient and each high cost drug and submit this to either a CCG or NHSEI specialised commissioning, based on which organisation is the commissioner, to recieve payment. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a secondary use these individual submissions can then be collected together to provide information on the total number of patients treated with high cost drugs, the volume of high cost drugs used and the cost of these medicines to commissioners. The dataset also provides information on clinical indications, the reason a patient was treated with the high cost drug, and the month the patient was treated."

    "## Creation of the national high cost drugs dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The high cost drug payment request submissions are routinely collected together to produce datasets at an individual CCG and NHSEI specialised commissioning level. However, despite clear use cases for national policy and clinical teams, academics and other stakeholders, this data had never been collected together to provide a national overview of the use of high cost drugs in England prior to the work of the North of England Commissioing Support Unit (NECS) and the DataLab in spring/summer 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "*To add information on how national data collection was proposed/approved*\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the first national high cost drugs dataset the NECS collected submissions from all commissioners in England - this covers *135?* CCGs and NHSEI specialised commissioning. The scope of the original dataset was all high cost drugs sumbissions from FY 2018/19 and FY 2019/20.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NECS faced a number of challenges in collecting and collating the submissions from this range of providers, particularly around data uniformity and validation. The impact of these challenges are discussed for each variable where relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveats**\n",
    "* The NECS are unable to say with any certainty that the data received is a complete data set for each Provider and Commissioner. \n",
    "* The drug names and other text inputs are non-standardised, further work is required to standardise variables in the dataset.\n",
    "* The NECS are unable to comment on the level of data validation that has been undertaken before it was submitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further information on the NECS data collation and cleaning processes can be found in [this document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JbUPp962KRNGsIC1wThexdMUrV0XOb-D/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs)"

    "## Analysing high cost drugs data in OpenSAFELY-TPP\n",
    "\n",
    "High cost drugs data is available for analysis via the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform to answer COVID-19 related research questions. The high cost drugs data can be analysed via OpenSAFELY study definitions and linked to information from patient GP records, COVID-19 related datasets (tests and results), hospital admissions and episodes data and data on patient outcomes. This will allow new insight in to the possible interactions between the medication a patient takes and COVID outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, three variables from the high cost drugs dataset can be queried in an OpenSAFELY study:\n",
    "* FinancialMonth\n",
    "* FinancialYear\n",
    "* DrugName\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables are the ones most relevant to current research questions which add new information not available in other OpenSAFELY-TPP datasets and are also the most complete. Other variables included in the high cost drugs dataset are described in Table 1 below along with a brief overview of data completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to analyse OpenSAFELY-TPP data via OpenSAFELY study definitions are set out in this [guidance](https://docs.opensafely.org/en/latest/). There are some specific things to note when including the high cost drugs dataset in any analysis:\n",
    "* You will need to create bespoke codelists to cover the medications of interest. \n",
    "    * A list of the existing high cost drugs codelists on OpenSAFELY codelists can be found [here](https://codelists.opensafely.org/?q=High+cost+drugs). Check this to see if a codelist already exists for your medications of interest.\n",
    "    * If a codelist does not already exist then you will need to create one. These codelists will need to be based on the unique values of the drug name variable. A list of all the unique values for the drug name variable can be found here (add link!).\n",
    "    * Once you have created the codelist/lists for the medicines of interest these need to be uploaded to [OpenSAFELY codelists](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/add/).\n",
    "    \n",
    "* When you are ready to run your study definition and analysis via the [Job Runner](https://jobs.opensafely.org/) you will need to run on the full set of data as the high cost drugs dataset is not yet included in the slice of data (which can be used to test your study runs as expected)."

    "The national high cost drugs dataset is a patient level dataset and includes variables on patient characteristics, clinical indications and medicine prescribed.\n",

    "The NECS collated together the submissions from each CCG and NHSEI specialised commissioning to create a national dataset. The version of this dataset shared with OpenSafely and TPP includes a subset of the variables from the national specification and some derived variables. The dataset shared with OpenSafely and TPP only includes patients that are or were registered at a GP practice that uses the TPP EHRC systems. This data collection is therefore a sample of the full national high cost drugs dataset that the NECS produced.\n",
